# MG_ART

MG_ART is a Web Application that will demonstrate a portfolio and an e-commerce system
is still in proceccs as it has a lot of things to be implemented. So far on the project
it make use of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jinja2 and Flask for the backend. The reason why 
Flask is the back-end technology, it is because Flask is a micro-framework which makes
it faster as it has little dependency to update and watch for security bugs. Flask also 
make use of Jinja2 template engine, for having a static layout and to pass data on the 
templates. Furthermore, the Web Application has media queries to make it responsive
and a variety of animmations.
